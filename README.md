Installion
============

put CropReader.jar in your imageJ plugin directory.

It require bioformats, loci, and auto thresholding.

Simply, use fiji and put this into fiji's plugin directory.


Caution
============

This require larger memory against large image.

I recommend over 16G memory for a file over 2G pix.

Be carefully about imageJ with this plugin making your workstation unstable.
